**DESCRIPTION: The task is to program a Image classification model. This program implements a CNN for image classification using PYTORCH. The application focuses on classifying currency images into their respective denominations. The data is split into training,validation and testing sets. An EfficientNetB3 model is used as the backbone. Its final classification layer is modified to match the number of currency classes. The model is trained using various lr(s), and the best performing one is selected based on the validation accuracy. The training is done over 5 Epochs and retains the best model weights. The final model is evaluated on the test set and also used for inference on new images.The project successfully fulfills the deliverable of producing a functional CNN-based image classifier with performance evaluation on a test dataset.
